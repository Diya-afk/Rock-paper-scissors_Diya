Rock Paper Scissors AI 🎮🤖

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors AI GitHub repository! This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with an AI opponent. The AI is designed to analyze the player's moves and make strategic decisions based on probabilities.

🚀 Features

Single-player mode against an AI opponent.

AI learns and adapts to player patterns.

Command-line interface for quick and easy gameplay.

Random or strategy-based AI decisions.

Clear and readable Python code for educational purposes.


🛠️ Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-ai.git
cd rock-paper-scissors-ai


2. Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

🧠 How the AI Works

The AI can choose its move randomly or based on pattern recognition.

It tracks the player's previous choices and adjusts its strategy.

Over multiple rounds, the AI attempts to predict the player's next move.
